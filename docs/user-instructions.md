## User Instructions

> In Fireman you can play as the fireman or the arsonist. Each has their own way of playing with
> unique moves, and both players must find a way to outmanouver their opponent in this turn-based
> game.

> As a Fireman, you can shoot water that will WET a whole row or column, turning off any fires in
> that line. You can also throw a water bomb, which will WET up to four plots in each use. The water
> bomb can be used twice per game.

> The terrain plots that get WET can not be turned ON FIRE by the arsonist for one turn. The plots
> that were on fire and get turned off will become points for the fireman.

> As the Arsonist, you can touch a plot to turn it on fire. You can make one new fire per turn. If
> you turn a plot on fire and the fireman does not turn it off in the next turn, the plot will become
> CHARRED, and it will be a point for the arsonist.

> Upon starting a new game, there will already be some fires in the terrain. The fires will
> propagate to three adjacent plots. The direction of the wind (shown by an arrow) will show the
> players where the fire will spread to.

> The game is over if one of two conditions is met; If the terrain is more than 50% CHARRED, the
> arsonist wins. If all fires are extinguished, the fireman wins.
