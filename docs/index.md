## Summary

[//]: # (TODO Replace this paragraph with one or more paragraphs summarizing the purpose and operation of the Android app you propose to develop in this project.)

## Intended users and user stories

[//]: # (If you are a person who likes to play strategy games while with some friends or in your free time, you may want to play fireman in order to keep everyone busy while having fun and learn something about real fires.)
[//]: # (As a person who has always played board games with strategy involved, I enjoy a game that can be quick yet entertaining, I play fireman to keep my mind busy as well as allowing my brain to work through tough problems.)

## Functionality

[//]: # (TODO List &#40;using a bullet list---or ordered list, if order is relevant&#41; the key functional aspects that will be provided by the app---i.e., tell us what the user will be able to do using the app. This should not simply be a re-statement of the [summary]&#40;#summary&#41;, but should instead provide a more specific articulation of the functionality and user experience. )

## Persistent data

[//]: # (For our server side application we will be providing Google sign in so that players can be unique and keep trac of there past scores and wins, as well as being able to play a turn at any time with another player.

## Device/external services

[//]: # (TODO If the client component will need to access special services of the client device &#40;e.g., sensors, contacts, messaging&#41;, list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services &#40;e.g., real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database&#41;, those should also be listed here.)

## Stretch goals and possible enhancements 

[//]: # (TODO If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.)
