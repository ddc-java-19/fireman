## Summary

[//]: # (Project description: In Fireman, two players compete with opposite goals: the Arsonist aims to ignite fires across the game board, while the other plays as the Fireman trying to extinguish those flames. The game board is divided into tiles, each representing a potential fire zone, which can either be set ablaze or kept safe depending on the players' actions. Each player has unique abilities and strategies designed to support their role, making each turn a strategic attempt to either grow or shrink the active fires on the board.)

[//]: # (The game continues until one player secures a majority of the tiles in their favor. If the Arsonist manages to spread flames over more tiles by the end of the game, they win. However, the fireman player can secure victory by containing or putting out every active fire, achieving complete control over the board. With plenty of room for strategy, Fireman combines fast-paced decisions with competitive, role-based play, challenging players to outmaneuver each other and gain control of the game board.)

## Intended users and user stories

[//]: # (TODO Write a bullet list here, including at least 2 different types of intended users. Along with each type of intended user, include at least 1 _user story_. A user story is usually just 1 simple sentence &#40;no more than 2 sentences&#41;, in the voice of the intended user, stating a specific task that the user performs using the app, and the benefit that will be obtained. See rubric for required form.)

## Functionality

[//]: # (TODO List &#40;using a bullet list---or ordered list, if order is relevant&#41; the key functional aspects that will be provided by the app---i.e., tell us what the user will be able to do using the app. This should not simply be a re-statement of the [summary]&#40;#summary&#41;, but should instead provide a more specific articulation of the functionality and user experience. )

## Persistent data

[//]: # (Persistent Data:
*Game Board Layout
*Win/Loss Records Against Friends
*User Profiles and Authentication
*Game Settings
*Game Progress for Incomplete Games)

## Device/external services

[//]: # (TODO If the client component will need to access special services of the client device &#40;e.g., sensors, contacts, messaging&#41;, list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services &#40;e.g., real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database&#41;, those should also be listed here.)

## Stretch goals and possible enhancements 

[//]: # (TODO If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.)
